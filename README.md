# Predicting-the-scoreline-of-a-Football-Match
Aim of this code is to analyse and predict the scoreline of an International Football match.

## Part 1: DATA
Players data is personally webscraped by me from sofifa.com and it is the 2020 fifa data.
Will webscrape the player's detailed data and upload the code and data here soon.
International Match result is downloaded from Kaggle.

## Part 2: Predicting scoreline without Machine Learning: Using Poisson's help
For that I have written a blog in analyticsVidhya , here's the link to it : https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/predicting-the-scoreline-of-a-football-match-using-poisson-distribution/
The notebook regarding the above is uploaded here.

## Part 3: Gathering insights(Asking questions and using data to answer) from the data.
This is an ongoing project and I am currently woking on this. Will upload here once its done.

## Part 4: Predicting the match result(classification) and using it in determining the scoreline(regression or multilabel multiclass classification):
This is an ongoing project and I am currently woking on this. Will upload here once its done.
